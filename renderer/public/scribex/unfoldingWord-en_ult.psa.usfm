\s5
\ms Book One
\c 1
\q
\v 1 Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of the wicked,
\q or stand in the pathway with sinners,
\q or sit in the assembly of mockers.
\q
\v 2 But his delight is in the law of Yahweh,
\q and on his law he meditates day and night.

\s5
\q
\v 3 He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water
\q that produces its fruit in its season,
\q whose leaves do not wither;
\q whatever he does will prosper.

\s5
\q
\v 4 The wicked are not so,
\q but are instead like the chaff that the wind drives away.
\q
\v 5 So the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
\q nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.

\s5
\q
\v 6 For Yahweh approves of the way of the righteous,
\q but the way of the wicked will perish.

\s5
\c 2
\m
\q
\v 1 Why are the nations in turmoil,
\q and why do the peoples make plots that will fail?
\q
\v 2 The kings of the earth take their stand together
\q and the rulers conspire together
\q against Yahweh and against his Messiah, saying,
\q
\v 3 "Let us tear off the shackles they put on us
\q and throw off their chains."

\s5
\q
\v 4 He who sits in the heavens will sneer at them;
\q the Lord mocks them.
\q
\v 5 Then he will speak to them in his anger
\q and terrify them in his rage, saying,

\s5
\q
\v 6 "I myself have anointed my king
\q on Zion, my holy mountain."
\q
\v 7 I will announce a decree of Yahweh.
\q He said to me, "You are my son!
\q This day I have become your father.

\s5
\q
\v 8 Ask me, and I will give you the nations for your inheritance
\q and the farthermost regions of the earth for your possession.
\q
\v 9 You will break them with an iron rod;
\q like a jar of a potter, you will smash them to pieces."

\s5
\q
\v 10 So now, you kings, be warned;
\q be corrected, you rulers of the earth.
\q
\v 11 Worship Yahweh in fear
\q and rejoice with trembling.

\s5
\q
\v 12 Kiss the son or he will be angry with you,
\q2 and you will die in the way when his anger burns for just a moment.
\q How blessed are all those who seek refuge in him.


\s5
\c 3
\m
\d A psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, how many are my enemies!
\q Many have risen against me.
\q
\v 2 Many say about me,
\q "There is no help for him from God."
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 3 But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me,
\q my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.
\q
\v 4 I lift up my voice to Yahweh,
\q and he answers me from his holy hill.
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 5 I lay down and slept;
\q I awoke, for Yahweh protected me.
\q
\v 6 I will not be afraid of the multitudes of people
\q who have set themselves against me on every side.

\s5
\q
\v 7 Rise up, Yahweh! Save me, my God!
\q For you will hit all my enemies on the jaw;
\q you will break the teeth of the wicked.
\q
\v 8 Salvation comes from Yahweh.
\q May your blessings be on your people.
\qs Selah\qs*


\s5
\c 4
\m
\d For the chief musician; on stringed instruments. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness;
\q give me room when I am hemmed in.
\q Have mercy on me and listen to my prayer.

\s5
\q
\v 2 You people, how long will you turn my honor into shame?
\q How long will you love that which is worthless and seek after lies?
\qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 3 But know that Yahweh has set apart the faithful ones for himself.
\q Yahweh will hear when I call to him.

\s5
\q
\v 4 Tremble in fear, but do not sin!
\q Meditate in your heart on your bed and be silent.
\qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness
\q and put your trust in Yahweh.

\s5
\q
\v 6 Many say, "Who will show us anything good?"
\q Yahweh, lift up the light of your face on us.
\q
\v 7 You have given my heart more gladness
\q than others have when their grain and new wine abound.
\q
\v 8 It is in peace that I will lie down and sleep,
\q for you alone, Yahweh, make me safe and secure.


\s5
\c 5
\m
\d For the chief musician; with wind instruments. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Listen to my call to you, Yahweh;
\q think about my groanings.
\q
\v 2 Listen to the sound of my call, my King and my God,
\q for it is to you that I pray.
\q
\v 3 Yahweh, in the morning you hear my cry;
\q in the morning I will bring my petition to you and wait expectantly.

\s5
\q
\v 4 Certainly you are not a God who approves of evil;
\q evil people will not be your guests.
\q
\v 5 The arrogant will not stand in your presence;
\q you hate all who behave wickedly.
\q
\v 6 You will destroy liars;
\q Yahweh despises violent and deceitful men.

\s5
\q
\v 7 But as for me, because of your great covenant faithfulness, I will come into your house;
\q in reverence I will bow down toward your holy temple.
\q
\v 8 Oh Lord, lead me in your righteousness because of my enemies;
\q make your path straight before me.

\s5
\q
\v 9 For there is no truth in their mouth;
\q their inward being is wicked;
\q their throat is an open tomb;
\q they flatter with their tongue.
\q
\v 10 Declare them guilty, God;
\q may their schemes be their downfall!
\q Drive them out for their many transgressions,
\q for they have rebelled against you.

\s5
\q
\v 11 But may all those who take refuge in you rejoice;
\q let them always shout for joy because you defend them;
\q let them be joyful in you, those who love your name.
\q
\v 12 For you will bless the righteous, Yahweh;
\q you will surround them with favor as with a shield.


\s5
\c 6
\m
\d For the chief musician; on stringed instruments, set to the Sheminith style. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, do not rebuke me in your anger
\q or discipline me in your wrath.
\q
\v 2 Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am frail;
\q heal me, Yahweh, for my bones are shaking.

\s5
\q
\v 3 My soul also is very troubled.
\q But you, Yahweh—how long will this continue?
\q
\v 4 Return, Yahweh! rescue me.
\q Save me because of your covenant faithfulness!
\q
\v 5 For in death there is no remembrance of you.
\q In Sheol who will give you thanks?

\s5
\q
\v 6 I am weary with my groaning.
\q All night I drench my bed with tears;
\q I wash my couch away with my tears.
\q
\v 7 My eyes grow dim from grief;
\q they grow weak because of all my adversaries.

\s5
\q
\v 8 Get away from me, all you who practice iniquity;
\q for Yahweh has heard the sound of my weeping.
\q
\v 9 Yahweh has heard my appeal for mercy;
\q Yahweh has accepted my prayer.
\q
\v 10 All my enemies will be ashamed and greatly troubled.
\q They will turn back and be suddenly humiliated.


\s5
\c 7
\m
\d A musical composition of David, which he sang to Yahweh concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh my God, I take refuge in you!
\q Save me from all who chase me, and rescue me.
\q
\v 2 Otherwise, they will rip me apart like a lion,
\q tearing me in pieces with no one else able to bring me to safety.

\s5
\q
\v 3 Yahweh my God, if I have done this, 
\q and there is guilt on my hands—
\q
\v 4 if I have done evil to him who was at peace with me,
\q or senselessly harmed my enemy without cause, then hear my words.

\s5
\q
\v 5 Then let my enemy pursue my life and overtake me;
\q let him trample my life to the ground
\q and lay my honor in the dust.
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 6 Arise, Yahweh, in your anger;
\q stand up against the rage of my enemies;
\q wake up for my sake and carry out the righteous decrees that you have commanded for them.
\q
\v 7 The countries are assembled all around you;
\q take once more your rightful place over them.

\s5
\q
\v 8 Yahweh, judge the nations;
\q vindicate me, Yahweh, because I am righteous and innocent, Most High.
\q
\v 9 May the evil deeds of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous people,
\q righteous God, you who examine hearts and minds.

\s5
\q
\v 10 My shield comes from God,
\q the one who saves the upright in heart.
\q
\v 11 God is a righteous judge,
\q a God who is indignant each day.

\s5
\q
\v 12 If a person does not repent, God will sharpen his sword
\q and will prepare his bow for battle.
\q
\v 13 He prepares to use weapons against him;
\q he makes his arrows flaming shafts.

\s5
\q
\v 14 Think about the one who is pregnant with wickedness,
\q who conceives destructive plans, who gives birth to harmful lies.
\q
\v 15 He digs a pit and hollows it out
\q and then falls into the hole he has made.
\q
\v 16 His own destructive plans return to his own head,
\q for his violence comes down on his own head.

\s5
\q
\v 17 I will give thanks to Yahweh for his justice;
\q I will sing praise to Yahweh Most High.


\s5
\c 8
\m
\d For the chief musician; set to the gittith style. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh our Lord, how magnificent is your name in all the earth,
\q you who reveal your glory in the heavens above.
\q
\v 2 Out of the mouth of babies and infants you have established praise \f + \ft The Hebrew text can be read either as \fqa established praise \fqa* or \fqa established strength \fqa* . \f*
\q because of your enemies,
\q so that you might silence both the enemy and the avenger.

\s5
\q
\v 3 When I look up at your heavens, which your fingers have made,
\q the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,
\q
\v 4 Of what importance is the human race that you notice them,
\q or mankind that you pay attention to them?
\q
\v 5 Yet you have made them only a little lower than the heavenly beings
\q and have crowned them with glory and honor.

\s5
\q
\v 6 You make him to rule over the works of your hands;
\q you have put all things under his feet:
\q
\v 7 all sheep and oxen,
\q and even the animals of the field,
\q
\v 8 the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea,
\q everything that passes through the currents of the seas.

\s5
\q
\v 9 Yahweh our Lord,
\q how magnificent is your name in all the earth!


\s5
\c 9
\m
\d For the chief musician; set to Muth Labben style. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart;
\q I will tell about all your marvelous deeds.
\q
\v 2 I will be glad and rejoice in you;
\q I will sing praise to your name, Most High!

\s5
\q
\v 3 When my enemies turn back,
\q they stumble and perish before you.
\q
\v 4 For you have defended my just cause;
\q you sit on your throne, a righteous judge!

\s5
\q
\v 5 You rebuked the nations;
\q you have destroyed the wicked;
\q you have blotted out their name forever and ever.
\q
\v 6 The enemy crumbled like ruins
\q when you overthrew their cities.
\q All remembrance of them has perished.

\s5
\q
\v 7 But Yahweh remains forever;
\q he has established his throne for justice.
\q
\v 8 He will judge the world with righteousness,
\q and he will execute judgment for the nations with fairness.

\s5
\q
\v 9 Yahweh also will be a stronghold for the oppressed,
\q a stronghold in times of trouble.
\q
\v 10 Those who know your name trust in you,
\q for you, Yahweh, do not abandon those who seek you.

\s5
\q
\v 11 Sing praises to Yahweh, who rules in Zion;
\q tell the nations what he has done.
\q
\v 12 For the God who avenges bloodshed remembers;
\q he does not forget the cry of the oppressed.

\s5
\q
\v 13 Have mercy on me, Yahweh; see how I am oppressed by those who hate me,
\q you who can snatch me from the gates of death.
\q
\v 14 Oh, that I might proclaim all your praise.
\q In the gates of the daughter of Zion
\q I will rejoice in your salvation!

\s5
\q
\v 15 The nations have sunk down into the pit that they made;
\q their feet are caught in the net that they hid.
\q
\v 16 Yahweh has made himself known; he has executed judgment;
\q the wicked is ensnared by his own actions.
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 17 The wicked are turned back and sent to Sheol,
\q all the nations that forget God.
\q
\v 18 For the needy will not always be forgotten,
\q nor will the hope of the oppressed be forever dashed.

\s5
\q
\v 19 Arise, Yahweh; do not let man win against you;
\q may the nations be judged in your sight.
\q
\v 20 Terrify them, Yahweh;
\q may the nations know that they are mere men.
\qs Selah\qs*


\s5
\c 10
\m
\q
\v 1 Why, Yahweh, do you stand far off?
\q Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
\q
\v 2 Because of their arrogance, wicked people chase the oppressed;
\q but please let the wicked be trapped by their own schemes that they have devised.
\q
\v 3 For the wicked person boasts of his deepest desires;
\q he blesses the greedy and insults Yahweh.

\s5
\q
\v 4 The wicked man has a raised face; he does not seek God.
\q He never thinks about God because he does not care at all about him.
\q
\v 5 He is secure at all times,
\q but your righteous decrees are too high for him;
\q he snorts at all his enemies.

\s5
\q
\v 6 He says in his heart," I will never fail;
\q throughout all generations I will not meet adversity."
\q
\v 7 His mouth is full of curses and lies and oppression;
\q under his tongue are mischief and evil. 

\s5
\q
\v 8 He waits in ambush near the villages;
\q in the secret places he murders the innocent;
\q his eyes look for some helpless victim.
\q
\v 9 He lurks in secret like a lion in the thicket;
\q he lies in wait to catch the oppressed.
\q He catches the oppressed when he pulls in his net.
\q
\v 10 His victims are crushed and beaten down;
\q they fall into his strong nets.

\s5
\q
\v 11 He says in his heart, "God has forgotten;
\q he covers his face; he will not bother to look."
\q
\v 12 Arise, Yahweh! Lift up your hand, God!
\q Do not forget the oppressed.

\s5
\q
\v 13 Why does the wicked man reject God
\q and say in his heart, "You will not hold me accountable"?
\q
\v 14 You have taken notice, for you always see the one who inflicts the misery and sorrow.
\q The helpless entrusts himself to you;
\q you rescue the fatherless.

\s5
\q
\v 15 Break the arm of the wicked and evil man.
\q Make him account for his evil deeds,
\q which he thought you would not discover.
\q
\v 16 Yahweh is King forever and ever;
\q the nations are driven out of his land.

\s5
\q
\v 17 Yahweh, you have heard the needs of the oppressed;
\q you strengthen their heart, you listen to their prayer;
\q
\v 18 You defend the fatherless and the oppressed
\q so that no man on the earth will cause terror again.


\s5
\c 11
\m
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 I take refuge in Yahweh;
\q how will you say to me,
\q "Flee like a bird to the mountain"?
\q
\v 2 For see! The wicked prepare their bows.
\q They make ready their arrows on the strings
\q to shoot in the darkness at the upright in heart.

\s5
\q
\v 3 For if the foundations are ruined,
\q what can the righteous do?
\q
\v 4 Yahweh is in his holy temple;
\q his eyes watch, his eyes examine the children of mankind.

\s5
\q
\v 5 Yahweh examines both the righteous and the wicked,
\q but he hates those who love to do violence.
\q
\v 6 He rains burning coals and brimstone upon the wicked;
\q a scorching wind will be their portion from his cup!
\q
\v 7 For Yahweh is righteous, and he loves righteousness;
\q the upright will see his face.


\s5
\c 12
\m
\d For the chief musician; set to the Sheminith. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Help, Yahweh, for the faithful ones have disappeared;
\q those who have integrity have vanished from the children of men.

\s5
\q
\v 2 Everyone says empty words to his neighbor;
\q everyone speaks with flattering lips and a double heart.
\q
\v 3 Yahweh, cut off all flattering lips,
\q every tongue declaring great things.
\q
\v 4 These are those who have said, "With our tongues will we prevail.
\q When our lips speak, who can be master over us?"

\s5
\q
\v 5 "Because of violence against the poor, because of the groans of the needy,
\q I will arise," says Yahweh.
\q "I will provide the safety for which they long."

\s5
\q
\v 6 The words of Yahweh are pure words,
\q like silver purified in a furnace on the earth,
\q refined seven times.
\q
\v 7 You are Yahweh! You keep them.
\q You preserve the godly people from this wicked generation and forever.
\q
\v 8 The wicked walk on every side
\q when evil is exalted among the children of mankind.


\s5
\c 13
\m
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 How long, Yahweh, will you keep forgetting about me?
\q How long will you hide your face from me?
\q
\v 2 How long must I worry
\q and have grief in my heart all day?
\q How long will my enemy triumph over me?

\s5
\q
\v 3 Look at me and answer me, Yahweh my God!
\q Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death.
\q
\v 4 Do not let my enemy say, "I have defeated him,"
\q so that my enemy may not say, "I have prevailed over my adversary"; otherwise, my enemies will rejoice when I am brought down.

\s5
\q
\v 5 But I have trusted in your covenant faithfulness;
\q my heart rejoices in your salvation.
\q
\v 6 I will sing to Yahweh
\q because he has treated me very generously.


\s5
\c 14
\m
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 A fool says in his heart, "There is no God."
\q They are corrupt and have done abominable iniquity;
\q there is no one who does good.

\s5
\q
\v 2 Yahweh looks down from heaven on the children of mankind
\q to see if there are any who understand,
\q who seek after him.
\q
\v 3 They have all turned away. Together they have become corrupt.
\q There is no one who does good, no, not one.

\s5
\q
\v 4 Do they not know anything, those who commit iniquity,
\q those who eat up my people as they eat bread,
\q but who do not call on Yahweh?

\s5
\q
\v 5 They tremble with dread,
\q for God is with the righteous assembly!
\q
\v 6 You want to humiliate the poor person
\q even though Yahweh is his refuge.

\s5
\q
\v 7 Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion!
\q When Yahweh brings back his people from the captivity,
\q then Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be glad!


\s5
\c 15
\m
\d A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, who may stay in your tabernacle?
\q Who may live on your holy hill?
\q
\v 2 Whoever walks blamelessly, does what is right
\q and speaks truth from his heart.

\s5
\q
\v 3 He does not slander with his tongue,
\q he does not harm others,
\q and he does not insult his neighbor.

\s5
\q
\v 4 The worthless person is despised in his eyes,
\q but he honors those who fear Yahweh.
\q He swears to his own disadvantage and does not take back his promises.
\q
\v 5 He does not charge interest when he lends money.
\q He does not take bribes to testify against the innocent.
\q He who does these things will never be shaken.


\s5
\c 16
\m
\d A michtam of David.
\q
\v 1 Protect me, God, for I take refuge in you.
\q
\v 2 I say to Yahweh, "You are my Lord; my goodness is nothing apart from you.
\q
\v 3 As for the holy people who are on the earth, they are noble people; all my delight is in them.

\s5
\q
\v 4 Their troubles will be increased, those who seek out other gods. I will not pour out drink offerings of blood to their gods
\q or lift up their names with my lips.

\s5
\q
\v 5 Yahweh, you are my chosen portion and my cup. You hold onto my lot.
\q
\v 6 Measuring lines have been laid for me in pleasant places; surely a pleasing inheritance is mine.

\s5
\q
\v 7 I will bless Yahweh, who counsels me; even at night my mind instructs me.
\q
\v 8 I set Yahweh before me at all times, so I will not be shaken from his right hand!

\s5
\q
\v 9 Therefore my heart is glad; my glory is rejoicing. Surely I will live in security.
\q
\v 10 For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol. You will not let your faithful one see the pit.

\s5
\q
\v 11 You teach me the path of life; abundant joy resides in your presence; delights abide in your right hand forever!"


\s5
\c 17
\m
\d A prayer of David.
\q
\v 1 Listen to my plea for justice, Yahweh; pay attention to my call for help!
\q Give ear to my prayer from lips without deceit.
\q
\v 2 Let my vindication come from your presence; let your eyes see what is right!

\s5
\q
\v 3 If you test my heart, if you come to me in the night,
\q you will purify me and will not find any evil plans; my mouth will not transgress.

\s5
\q
\v 4 As for the deeds of mankind, it is at the word of your lips that I have kept myself from the ways of the lawless.
\q
\v 5 My steps have held firmly to your tracks; my feet have not slipped.

\s5
\q
\v 6 I call to you, for you answer me, God; turn your ear to me and listen when I speak.
\q
\v 7 Show your covenant faithfulness in a wonderful way, you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their enemies!

\s5
\q
\v 8 Protect me like the apple of your eye; hide me under the shadow of your wings
\q
\v 9 from the presence of the wicked ones who assault me, my enemies who surround me.
\q
\v 10 They have no mercy on anyone; their mouths speak with pride.

\s5
\q
\v 11 They have surrounded my steps. They set their eyes to strike me to the ground.
\q
\v 12 They are like a lion eager for a victim, like a young lion crouching in hidden places.

\s5
\q
\v 13 Arise, Yahweh! Attack them! Throw them down on their faces! Rescue my life from the wicked by your sword!
\q
\v 14 Rescue me from men by your hand, Yahweh, from men of this world whose prosperity is in this life alone!
\q You will fill the bellies of your treasured ones with riches; they will have many children and will leave their wealth to their children.

\s5
\q
\v 15 As for me, I will see your face in righteousness; I will be satisfied, when I awake, with a sight of you.


\s5
\c 18
\m
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David, the servant of Yahweh, when he sang to Yahweh the words of this song on the day that Yahweh rescued him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He sang:
\q
\v 1 I love you, Yahweh, my strength.

\s5
\q
\v 2 Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, the one who brings me to safety; he is my God, my rock; I take refuge in him.
\q He is my shield, the horn of my salvation, and my stronghold.
\q
\v 3 I will call on Yahweh who is worthy to be praised, and I will be saved from my enemies.

\s5
\q
\v 4 The cords of death surrounded me, and the rushing waters of worthlessness overwhelmed me.
\q
\v 5 The cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death trapped me.

\s5
\q
\v 6 In my distress I called to Yahweh; I called for help to my God. He heard my voice from his temple;
\q my call for help went into his presence; it went into his ears.

\s5
\q
\v 7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of the mountains also trembled
\q and were shaken because God was angry.
\q
\v 8 Smoke went up from out of his nostrils, and blazing fire came out of his mouth. Coals were ignited by it.

\s5
\q
\v 9 He opened the heavens and came down, and thick darkness was under his feet.
\q
\v 10 He rode on a cherub and flew; he glided on the wings of the wind.

\s5
\q
\v 11 He made darkness a tent around him, heavy rainclouds in the skies.
\q
\v 12 Hailstones and coals of fire fell from the lightning before him.

\s5
\q
\v 13 Yahweh thundered in the heavens! The voice of the Most High shouted.
\f + \ft Some modern versions add after shouted, \fqa hailstones and coals of fire \fqa* this expression may be an accidental repetition from the previous verse. \f*
\q
\v 14 He shot his arrows and scattered his enemies; many lightning bolts dispersed them. 

\s5
\q
\v 15 Then the water channels appeared; 
\q1 the foundations of the world were laid bare 
\q1 at your rebuke, Yahweh,
\q at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.

\q
\v 16 He reached down from above; he took hold of me! He pulled me out of the surging water.
\q
\v 17 He rescued me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.

\s5
\q
\v 18 They came against me on the day of my distress but Yahweh was my support!
\q
\v 19 He set me free in a wide open place; he saved me because he was pleased with me.

\s5
\q
\v 20 Yahweh has rewarded me because of my righteousness; he has restored me because my hands were clean.
\q
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh and have not wickedly turned away from my God.

\s5
\q
\v 22 For all his righteous decrees have been before me; as for his statutes, I have not turned away from them.
\q
\v 23 I have also been innocent before him, and I have kept myself from sin.
\q
\v 24 Therefore Yahweh has restored me because of my righteousness, because my hands were clean before his eyes.

\s5
\q
\v 25 To the one who is faithful, you show yourself to be faithful;
\q2 to a man who is blameless, you show yourself to be blameless.
\q
\v 26 To anyone who is pure, you show yourself pure; but you are clever toward anyone who is twisted.

\s5
\q
\v 27 For you save afflicted people, but you bring down those with proud, uplifted eyes!
\q
\v 28 For you give light to my lamp; Yahweh my God lights up my darkness.
\q
\v 29 For by you I can run over a barricade; by my God I can leap over a wall.

\s5
\q
\v 30 As for God—his way is perfect! The word of Yahweh is pure!
\q He is a shield to everyone who takes refuge in him.
\q
\v 31 For who is God except Yahweh? Who is a rock except our God?
\q
\v 32 It is God who puts strength on me like a belt, who places the blameless person on his path.

\s5
\q
\v 33 He makes my feet swift like a deer and places me on the heights!
\q
\v 34 He trains my hands for war and my arms to bend a bow of bronze.

\s5
\q
\v 35 You have given me the shield of your salvation. Your right hand has supported me, and your favor has made me great.
\q
\v 36 You have made a wide place for my feet beneath me so that my feet have not slipped.

\s5
\q
\v 37 I pursued my enemies and caught them; I did not turn back until they were destroyed.
\q
\v 38 I smashed them so that they were unable to rise; they have fallen under my feet.
\q
\v 39 For you put strength on me like a belt for battle; you put under me those who rise up against me.

\s5
\q
\v 40 You gave me the back of my enemies' necks; I annihilated those who hated me.
\q
\v 41 They called for help, but no one saved them; they called out to Yahweh, but he did not answer them.
\q
\v 42 I beat them into fine pieces like dust before the wind; I threw them out like mud in the streets.

\s5
\q
\v 43 You rescued me from the disputes of people. You have made me the head over nations. People that I have not known serve me.
\q
\v 44 As soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me; foreigners were forced to bow to me.
\q
\v 45 The foreigners came trembling out of their strongholds.

\s5
\q
\v 46 Yahweh lives; may my rock be praised. May the God of my salvation be exalted.
\q
\v 47 He is the God who executes vengeance for me, who subdues the nations under me.

\s5
\q
\v 48 I am set free from my enemies! Indeed, you lifted me above the ones who rose against me! You rescued me from violent men.
\q
\v 49 Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations; I will sing praises to your name!

\s5
\q
\v 12 I am forgotten as a dead man whom no one thinks about.
\q I am like a broken pot.
\q
\v 13 For I have heard the whispering of many,

\q They plot to take away my life.

\s5
\q
\v 14 But I trust in you, Yahweh;
\q I say, "You are my God."

\v 15 My times are in your hand.
\q Rescue me from the hands of my enemies and from those who pursue me.


\q
\v 16 Make your face shine on your servant;

\s5
\q
\v 17 Do not let me be humiliated, Yahweh; for I call out to you!
\q May the wicked be humiliated! May they be silent in Sheol.
\q
\v 18 May lying lips be silenced
\q that speak against the righteous defiantly
\q with arrogance and contempt.

\s5
\q
\v 19 How great is your goodness
\q that you have stored up for those who revere you,
\q that you perform for those who take refuge in you
\q before all the children of mankind!
\q
\v 20 In the shelter of your presence, you hide them from the plots of men.
\q You hide them in a shelter from the violence of tongues.

\s5
\q
\v 21 Blessed be Yahweh,
\q for he showed me his marvelous covenant faithfulness when I was in a besieged city.
\q
\v 22 Though I said in my haste,
\q "I am cut off from your eyes,"
\q yet you heard my plea for help
\q when I cried to you.

\s5
\q
\v 23 Love Yahweh, all you faithful ones.

\q
\v 1 Blessed is the person whose transgression is forgiven,

\q
\v 2 Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh reckons no guilt
\q and in whose spirit there is no deceit.

\s5
\q
\v 3 When I remained silent, my bones were wasting away
\q while I groaned all day long.
\q
\v 4 For day and night your hand was heavy upon me.
\q My strength withered as in summer drought.
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 5 Then I acknowledged my sin to you,
\q and I no longer hid my iniquity.
\q I said, "I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh,"
\q and you forgave the guilt of my sin.
\qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 6 For this reason every one of your faithful followers should pray to you at a time of great distress.
\q When the surging waters overflow, the waters will not reach them.

\s5

\q You will surround me with the songs of victory.
\qs Selah\qs*

\v 8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go.
\q I will instruct you with my eye upon you.

\q
\v 9 Do not be like a horse or like a mule, which have no understanding;
\q it is only with bridle and bit to control them
\q that they will go where you want them to.
\q
\v 10 The wicked have many sorrows,
\q but Yahweh's covenant faithfulness will surround the one who trusts in him.

\s5

\s5

\q
\v 1 Rejoice in Yahweh, you righteous;

\q
\v 2 Give thanks to Yahweh with the harp;
\q sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings.
\q
\v 3 Sing to him a new song;
\q play skillfully and sing with joy.

\s5
\q
\v 4 For Yahweh's word is upright,
\q and everything he does is fair.
\q
\v 5 He loves righteousness and justice.
\q The earth is full of Yahweh's covenant faithfulness.
\q
\v 6 By the word of Yahweh the heavens were made,
\q and all the stars were made by the breath of his mouth.

\s5
\q
\v 7 He gathers the waters of the sea together like a heap;
\q he puts the oceans in storehouses.
\q
\v 8 Let the whole earth fear Yahweh;
\q let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
\q
\v 9 For he spoke, and it was done;
\q he commanded, and it stood in place.


\s5
\q
\v 10 Yahweh frustrates the alliances of nations;

\q
\v 11 The plans of Yahweh stand forever,

\q
\v 12 Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh,

\s5
\q
\v 13 Yahweh looks from heaven;

\q
\v 14 From the place where he lives,

\s5
\q
\v 16 No king is saved by a vast army;

\s5
\q
\v 15 The eyes of Yahweh are on the righteous
\q and his ears are directed toward their cry.
\q
\v 16 The face of Yahweh is against those who do evil,

\q
\v 17 The righteous cry out and Yahweh hears

\q
\v 2 Grab your small shield and large shield;

\q
\v 3 Use your spear and battle ax against those who chase me;

\v 8 Let destruction overtake them by surprise.
\q Let the net that they have set catch them.

\s5

\q
\v 12 They repay me evil for good.
\q I am sorrowful.

\s5
\q
\v 13 But, when they were sick, I wore sackcloth;

\q with my head bowed on my chest.
\q
\v 14 I went about in grief as for my brother;
\q I bent down in mourning as for my mother.

\s5
\q
\v 15 But when I stumbled, they rejoiced and gathered together;

\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David the servant of Yahweh.
\q
\v 1 An evil man speaks of his transgression from deep in his heart, 
\q there is no fear of God in his eyes.
\q
\v 2 For he comforts himself,
\q thinking that his sin will not be discovered and be hated.

\s5
\q
\v 3 His words are sinful and deceitful;
\q he does not want to be wise and do good.
\q
\v 4 While he lies in bed, he plans ways to sin;
\q he sets out on an evil way;
\q he does not reject evil.

\s5
\q
\v 5 Your covenant faithfulness, Yahweh, reaches to the heavens;
\q your loyalty reaches to the clouds.
\q
\v 6 Your righteousness is like the mountains of God;
\q your judgments are like the great deep.
\q Yahweh, you preserve both mankind and the animals.

\s5
\q
\v 7 How precious is your covenant faithfulness, God!
\q Humanity takes refuge under the shadow of your wings.
\q
\v 8 They feast upon the abundance of your house;
\q you let them drink from the river of your delights.
\q
\v 9 For with you is the fountain of life;
\q in your light we will see light.

\s5
\q
\v 10 Extend your covenant faithfulness fully to those who know you,
\q your defense to the upright of heart.
\q
\v 11 Do not let the foot of the arrogant man come near to me.
\q Do not let the hand of the wicked drive me away.
\q
\v 12 Over there the evildoers have fallen;
\q they are knocked down and are not able to get up.


\s5
\c 37
\m
\d A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Do not be irritated because of evildoers;
\q do not be envious of those who act unrighteously.
\q
\v 2 For they will soon dry up as the grass
\q and wither as the green plants.

\s5
\q
\v 3 Trust in Yahweh and do what is good;
\q settle in the land and graze in faithfulness.
\q
\v 4 Then delight yourself in Yahweh,
\q and he will give you the desires of your heart.

\s5
\q
\v 5 Give your ways to Yahweh;
\q trust in him, and he will act on your behalf.
\q
\v 6 He will display your justice like the daylight
\q and your innocence like the day at noon.

\s5
\q
\v 7 Be still before Yahweh and wait patiently for him.
\q Do not be angry if someone succeeds in what he does,
\q or when he makes evil plots.


\s5
\q
\v 8 Do not be angry and frustrated.
\q Do not worry. This only makes trouble.
\q
\v 9 Evildoers will be cut off,
\q but those who wait for Yahweh will inherit the land.
\q
\v 10 In a little while the evil man will disappear;
\q you will look at his place, but he will be gone.

\s5
\q
\v 11 But the meek will inherit the land
\q and will delight in great prosperity.
\q
\v 12 The wicked man plots against the righteous
\q and he grinds his teeth in rage against him.
\q
\v 13 The Lord laughs at him,
\q for he sees that his day is coming.

\s5
\q
\v 14 The wicked have drawn out their swords and have bent their bows
\q to cast down the oppressed and needy,
\q to kill those who are upright.
\q
\v 15 Their swords will pierce their own hearts,
\q and their bows will be broken.

\s5
\q
\v 16 Better is the little that the righteous has
\q than the abundance of many wicked people.
\q
\v 17 For the arms of the wicked people will be broken,
\q but Yahweh supports the righteous people.

\s5
\q
\v 18 Yahweh watches over the blameless day by day,
\q and their heritage will be forever.
\q
\v 19 They will not be ashamed when times are bad.
\q When famine comes, they will have enough to eat.

\s5
\q
\v 20 But evil men will perish.
\q Yahweh's enemies will be like the glory of the pastures;
\q they will be consumed and disappear in the smoke.
\q
\v 21 The wicked person borrows but does not repay,
\q but the righteous person is generous and gives.

\s5
\q
\v 22 Those who are blessed by God will inherit the land;
\q those who are cursed by him will be cut off.
\q
\v 23 It is by Yahweh that a man's steps are established,
\q the man whose way is commendable in God's sight.
\q
\v 24 Though he stumbles, he will not fall down,
\q for Yahweh is holding him with his hand.

\s5
\q
\v 25 I was young and now am old;
\q I have never seen the righteous person abandoned
\q or his children begging for bread.
\q
\v 26 All the day long he is gracious and lends,
\q and his children become a blessing.
\q
\v 27 Turn away from evil and do what is right;
\q then you will be safe forever.

\s5
\q
\v 28 For Yahweh loves justice
\q and does not abandon his faithful ones.
\q They are preserved forever,
\q but the descendants of the wicked will be cut off.
\q
\v 29 The righteous will inherit the land
\q and live there forever.
\q
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous person speaks wisdom
\q and increases justice.

\s5
\q
\v 31 The law of his God is in his heart;
\q his feet will not slip.
\q
\v 32 The wicked person watches the righteous person
\q and seeks to kill him.
\q
\v 33 Yahweh will not abandon him into the evil person's hand
\q or condemn him when he is judged.

\s5
\q
\v 34 Wait for Yahweh and keep his way,
\q and he will raise you up to possess the land.
\q You will see when the wicked are cut off.

\s5
\q
\v 35 I have seen the wicked and terrifying person
\q spread out like a green tree in its native soil.
\q
\v 36 But when I passed by again, he was not there.
\q I looked for him, but he could not be found.

\s5
\q
\v 37 Observe the man of integrity, and mark the upright;
\q there is a good future for a man of peace.
\q
\v 38 Sinners will be totally destroyed;
\q the future for the wicked man is cut off.

\s5
\q
\v 39 Salvation of the righteous comes from Yahweh;
\q he protects them in the times of trouble.
\q
\v 40 Yahweh helps them and rescues them.
\q He rescues them from evil men and saves them
\q because they have taken refuge in him.

\s5

\q Heal me, for I have sinned against you."
\q
\v 5 My enemies speak evil against me, saying,
\q 'When will he die and his name perish?'
\q
\v 6 If my enemy comes to see me, he says worthless things;
\q his heart gathers up my disaster for itself;
\q when he goes away from me, he tells others about it.

\s5
\q
\v 7 All who hate me whisper together against me;
\q against me they hope for my hurt.
\q
\v 8 They say, "An evil disease holds on tightly to him;
\q now that he is lying down, he will rise up no more."
\q
\v 9 Indeed, even my own close friend, in whom I trusted,
\q who ate my bread,
\q has lifted up his heel against me.

\s5
\q
\v 10 But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me and raise me up
\q so that I may pay them back.
\q
\v 11 By this I know that you delight in me,
\q for my enemy does not triumph over me.
\q
\v 12 As for me, you support me in my integrity
\q and will keep me before your face forever.

\d For the chief musician. A maschil of the sons of Korah.
\q
\v 1 As the deer pants after streams of water,
\q so I thirst for you, God.
\q
\v 2 I thirst for God, for the living God,
\q when will I come and appear before God?

\s5
\q
\v 3 My tears have been my food day and night,
\q while my enemies are always saying to me, "Where is your God?"
\q
\v 4 These things I call to mind as I pour out my soul:
\q how I went with the throng and led them to the house of God
\q with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude celebrating a festival.

\s5
\q
\v 5 Why are you bowed down, my soul?
\q Why are you upset within me?
\q Hope in God, for again I will praise him who is my salvation.


\q
\v 6 My God, my soul is bowed down within me,
\q therefore I call you to mind from the land of the Jordan,
\q from the three peaks of Mount Hermon, and from the hill of Mizar.

\s5
\q
\v 7 Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls;
\q all your waves and your billows have gone over me.
\q
\v 8 Yet Yahweh will command his covenant faithfulness in the daytime;
\q in the night his song will be with me,
\q a prayer to the God of my life.

\s5
\q
\v 9 I will say to God, my rock, "Why have you forgotten me?
\q Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"
\q
\v 10 As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries rebuke me,
\q while they always say to me, "Where is your God?"

\s5
\q
\v 11 Why are you bowed down, my soul?
\q Why are you upset within me?
\q Hope in God, for again I will praise him who is my salvation and my God.


\s5
\c 43
\m
\q
\v 1 Bring me justice, God, and plead my cause against a nation that is not faithful.
\q
\v 2 For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me?
\q Why do I go about in mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

\s5
\q
\v 3 Oh, send out your light and your truth, let them lead me.
\q Let them bring me to your holy hill
\q and to your dwelling.
\q
\v 4 Then I will go to the altar of God,
\q to God my exceeding joy.
\q I will praise you with the harp, God, my God.

\s5
\q

\d For the chief musician. A psalm of the sons of Korah. A maschil.
\q
\v 1 We have heard with our ears, God,
\q our fathers have told us
\q what work you did in their days,
\q in the days of old.
\q
\v 2 You drove out the nations with your hand,
\q but you planted our people;
\q you afflicted the peoples,
\q but you spread our people out in the land.

\s5
\q
\v 3 For they did not obtain the land for their possession by their own sword,
\q neither did their own arm save them;
\q but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face,
\q because you were favorable to them.
\q
\v 4 God, You are my King;
\q command victory for Jacob.

\s5
\q
\v 5 Through you we will push down our adversaries;
\q through your name we will tread them under, those who rise up against us.
\q
\v 6 For I will not trust in my bow,
\q neither will my sword save me.

\s5
\q
\v 7 But you have saved us from our adversaries,
\q and have put to shame those who hate us.
\q
\v 8 In God we have made our boast all the day long,
\q and we will give thanks to your name forever.
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 9 But now you have thrown us off and brought us dishonor,
\q and you do not go out with our armies.
\q
\v 10 You make us turn back from the adversary;
\q and those who hate us take spoil for themselves.
\q
\v 11 You have made us like sheep to be slaughtered
\q and have scattered us among the nations.

\s5
\q
\v 12 You sell your people for nothing;
\q you have not increased your wealth by doing so.
\q
\v 13 You make us a rebuke to our neighbors,
\q scoffed and mocked by those around us.
\q
\v 14 You make us an insult among the nations,
\q a shaking of the head among the peoples.

\s5
\q
\v 15 All the day long my dishonor is before me,
\q and the shame of my face has covered me
\q
\v 16 because of the voice of him who rebukes and insults,
\q because of the enemy and the avenger.
\q
\v 17 All this has come on us; yet we have not forgotten you
\q or dealt falsely with your covenant.

\s5
\q
\v 18 Our heart has not turned back;
\q our steps have not gone from your way.
\q
\v 19 Yet you have severely broken us in the place of jackals
\q and covered us with the shadow of death.
\q
\v 20 If we have forgotten the name of our God
\q or spread out our hands to a strange god,
\q
\v 21 would not God search this out?
\q For he knows the secrets of the heart.
\q
\v 22 Indeed, for your sake we are being killed all day long;
\q we are considered to be sheep for the slaughter.

\s5
\q
\v 23 Awake, why do you sleep, Lord?
\q Arise, do not throw us off permanently.
\q
\v 24 Why do you hide your face
\q and forget our affliction and our oppression?

\s5
\q
\v 25 For we have sunk down into the dust;
\q our bodies cling to the earth.
\q
\v 26 Rise up for our help
\q and redeem us for the sake of your covenant faithfulness.

\v 1 My heart overflows on a good subject;

\q
\v 2 You are fairer than the children of mankind;
\q grace is poured onto your lips;

\s5
\q
\v 3 Put your sword on your side, mighty one,

\q
\v 4 In your majesty ride on triumphantly
\q because of trustworthiness, meekness, and righteousness;

\s5
\q
\v 5 Your arrows are sharp;
\q the peoples fall under you;
\q your arrows are in the hearts of the king's enemies.
\q
\v 6 Your throne, God, is forever and ever;
\q a scepter of justice is the scepter of your kingdom.
\q
\v 7 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;
\q therefore God, your God, has anointed you
\q with the oil of gladness more than your companions.

\s5
\q
\v 8 All your garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia;
\q out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.
\q
\v 9 Kings' daughters are among your honorable women;
\q at your right hand stands the queen clothed in gold of Ophir.

\s5
\q
\v 10 Listen, daughter, consider and incline your ear;
\q forget your own people and your father's house.
\q
\v 11 In this way the king will desire your beauty;
\q he is your master; revere him.

\s5
\q
\v 12 The daughter of Tyre will be there with a gift;
\q the rich among the people will beg for your favor.
\q
\v 13 The royal daughter in the palace is all glorious;
\q her clothing is worked with gold.

\s5
\q
\v 14 She will be led to the king in embroidered dress;
\q the virgins, her companions who follow her,
\q will be brought to you.
\q
\v 15 They will be led by gladness and rejoicing;
\q they will enter into the king's palace.

\s5
\q
\v 16 In the place of your fathers will be your children,

\v 2 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth,
\q is Mount Zion, on the sides of the north,
\q the city of the great King.
\q
\v 3 God has made himself known in her palaces as a refuge.

\s5
\q
\v 4 For, see, the kings assembled themselves;

\v 2 both low and high,
\q rich and poor together.

\s5
\q
\v 3 My mouth will speak wisdom
\q and the meditation of my heart will be of understanding.
\q
\v 4 I will incline my ear to a parable;

\v 5 Why should I fear the days of evil,
\q when iniquity surrounds me at my heels?

\s5
\q
\v 6 Why should I fear those who trust in their wealth
\q and boast about the amount of their riches?
\q
\v 7 It is certain that no one can redeem his brother
\q or give God a ransom for him,
\q
\v 8 For the redemption of one's life is costly,
\q and no one can pay what we owe.

\s5
\q
\v 9 No one can live forever
\q so that his body should not decay.
\q
\v 10 For he will see decay. Wise men die;
\q the fool and the brute alike perish
\q and leave their wealth to others.

\s5
\q
\v 11 Their inner thought is that their families will continue forever,
\q and the places where they live, to all generations;
\q they call their lands after their own names.

\s5
\q
\v 12 But man, having wealth, does not remain alive;
\q he is like the beasts that perish.
\q
\v 13 This, their way, is their folly;
\q yet after them, men approve of their sayings.
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 14 Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol,
\q and death will be their shepherd.
\q The upright will rule over them in the morning,
\q and their bodies will be consumed in Sheol,

\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 16 Do not be afraid when one becomes rich,

\q
\v 17 For when he dies he will take nothing away;
\q his glory will not go down after him.

\s5
\q
\v 18 He blessed his soul while he lived—
\q and men praise you when you live for yourself—
\q
\v 19 he will go to the generation of his fathers

\q God has shone.

\s5
\q
\v 3 Our God comes and does not stay silent;
\q a fire devours before him,

\q
\v 4 He calls to the heavens above

\q
\v 5 "Gather my faithful ones together to me,

\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q

\q
\v 12 If I were hungry, I would not tell you;

\q that you have taken my covenant in your mouth,
\q
\v 17 since you hate instruction
\q and throw my words away?

\s5
\q
\v 18 When you see a thief, you agree with him;
\q you participate with those who commit adultery.

\q
\v 20 You sit and speak against your brother;
\q you slander your own mother's son.

\s5
\q
\v 21 You have done these things, but I have kept silent,
\q so you thought that I was someone just like yourself.
\q But I will reprove you and bring up, right before your eyes, all the things you have done.
\q
\v 22 Give this careful consideration, you who forget God,
\q otherwise I will tear you to pieces,
\q and there will be no one to come to help you!

\s5
\q
\v 3 For I know my transgressions,

\q you are correct when you judge.

\s5
\q
\v 5 See, I was born in iniquity;
\q as soon as my mother conceived me, I was in sin.
\q
\v 6 See, you desire trustworthiness in my inner self;

\s5
\q
\v 7 Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean;

\q
\v 1 Save me, God;
\q for the waters have put my life in danger.
\q
\v 2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no place to stand;
\q I have come into deep waters, where the floods flow over me.

\s5
\q
\v 3 I am weary with my crying; my throat is dry;
\q my eyes fail while I wait for my God.
\q
\v 4 Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs on my head;
\q those who would cut me off, being my enemies for wrong reasons, are mighty;
\q what I did not steal, I have to give back.

\s5
\q
\v 5 God, you know my foolishness,
\q and my sins are not hidden from you.
\q
\v 6 Let not those who hope in you be put to shame because of me, Lord Yahweh of hosts;
\q let not those who seek you be brought to dishonor because of me, God of Israel.

\s5
\q
\v 7 For your sake I have borne rebuke;
\q shame has covered my face.
\q
\v 8 I have become a stranger to my brothers,
\q an alien to my mother's children.
\q
\v 9 For the zeal of your house has eaten me up,
\q and the rebukes of those who rebuke you have fallen on me.

\s5
\q
\v 10 When I wept and did not eat food,
\q they insulted me.
\q
\v 11 When I made sackcloth my clothing,
\q I became the object of a proverb to them.
\q
\v 12 Those who sit in the city gate talk about me;
\q I am a song of drunkards.

\s5
\q
\v 13 But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, at a time that you will accept;
\q answer me in the trustworthiness of your salvation.
\q
\v 14 Pull me out of the mire, and do not let me sink;
\q let me be taken away from those who hate me and rescued out of the deep waters.
\q
\v 15 Do not let the floods of water overwhelm me,
\q neither let the deep swallow me up.
\q Do not let the pit shut its mouth on me.

\s5
\q
\v 16 Answer me, Yahweh, for your covenant faithfulness is good;
\q because your mercies for me are many, turn to me.
\q
\v 17 Do not hide your face from your servant,
\q for I am in distress; answer me quickly.

\s5
\q
\v 18 Come to me and redeem me.

\q my adversaries are all before you.

\s5
\q
\v 20 Rebuke has broken my heart; I am full of heaviness;
\q I looked for someone to take pity, but there was none;
\q I looked for comforters, but I found none.
\q
\v 21 They gave me poison for my food;
\q in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

\s5
\q
\v 22 Let their table before them become a snare;
\q when they think they are in safety, let it become a trap.
\q
\v 23 Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see;
\q and always make their loins shake.

\s5
\q
\v 24 Pour out your indignation on them,
\q and let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.
\q
\v 25 Let their place be a desolation;
\q let no one live in their tents.

\s5
\q
\v 26 For they persecuted the one you struck down.
\q They repeated the account of the pain of those you have wounded.
\q
\v 27 Accuse them of having committed iniquity after iniquity;
\q do not let them come into your righteous victory.

\s5
\q
\v 28 Let them be blotted out of the Book of Life
\q and not be written down along with the righteous.
\q
\v 29 But I am poor and sorrowful;
\q let your salvation, God, set me up on high.

\s5
\q
\v 30 I will praise the name of God with a song
\q and will exalt him with thanksgiving.
\q
\v 31 That will please Yahweh better than an ox
\q or a bull that has horns and hooves.

\s5
\q
\v 32 The meek have seen it and are glad;
\q you who seek after God, let your hearts live.
\q
\v 33 For Yahweh hears the needy
\q and does not despise his prisoners.

\s5
\q
\v 34 Let heaven and earth praise him,
\q the seas and everything that moves in them.
\q
\v 35 For God will save Zion and will rebuild the cities of Judah;

\s5
\q

\q
\v 9 Do not throw me away in my time of old age;

\s5
\q

\q
\v 13 Let them be put to shame and destroyed, those who are hostile to my life;

\s5
\q
\v 14 But I will always hope in you
\q and will praise you more and more.
\q
\v 15 My mouth will tell about your righteousness
\q and your salvation all the day,

\q
\v 16 I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh;

\q
\v 18 Indeed, even when I am old and gray-headed, God, do not forsake me,

\q
\v 3 May the mountains produce peace for the people;

\v 1 Surely God is good to Israel,
\q to those with a pure heart.
\q
\v 2 But as for me, my feet almost slipped;
\q my feet almost slipped out from under me
\q
\v 3 because I was envious of the arrogant
\q when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

\s5
\q
\v 4 For they have no pain until their death,
\q but they are strong and well fed.
\q
\v 5 They are free from the burdens of other men;
\q they are not afflicted like other men.

\s5
\q
\v 6 Pride adorns them like a necklace around their neck;
\q violence clothes them like a robe.
\q
\v 7 Out of such blindness comes sin;
\q evil thoughts pass through their hearts.

\s5
\q
\v 8 They mock and speak wickedly;
\q in their arrogance they threaten oppression.
\q
\v 9 They set their mouth against the heavens,
\q and their tongues march through the earth.

\s5
\q
\v 10 Therefore his people turn to them
\q and abundant waters are drained out.
\q
\v 11 They say, "How does God know?
\q Is there knowledge with the Most High?"
\q
\v 12 Take notice: these people are wicked;
\q they are always carefree, becoming richer and richer.

\s5
\q
\v 13 Surely it is in vain that I have guarded my heart
\q and washed my hands in innocence.
\q
\v 14 For all the day long I have been afflicted
\q and disciplined every morning.

\q then I would have betrayed this generation of your children.

\s5

\q They come to an end and are finished in awful terrors.
\q
\v 20 They are like a dream after one wakes up;
\q2 Lord, when you arise, you will think nothing of those dreams.

\s5
\q
\v 21 For my heart was grieved,
\q and I was deeply wounded.
\q
\v 22 I was ignorant and lacked insight;
\q I was like a senseless animal before you.

\s5
\q
\v 23 Yet I am always with you;
\q you hold my right hand.
\q
\v 24 You will guide me with your advice
\q and afterward receive me to glory.

\v 25 Whom have I in heaven but you?

\q and Mount Zion, where you live.

\s5
\q
\v 3 Come look at the complete ruins,
\q all the damage that the enemy has done in the holy place.
\q
\v 4 Your adversaries roared in the middle of your appointed place;
\q they set up their battle flags.
\q
\v 5 They hacked away with axes
\q as in a thick forest.
\q
\v 6 They smashed and broke down all the engravings;
\q they broke them with axes and hammers.

\s5
\q
\v 7 They set your sanctuary on fire;
\q they desecrated where you live, knocking it to the ground.
\q
\v 8 They said in their hearts, "We will destroy them all."
\q They burned up all of your meeting places in the land.

\s5
\q
\v 9 We do not see any more signs;
\q there is no prophet any more,
\q and no one among us knows how long this will last.
\q

\q Will the enemy blaspheme your name forever?
\q
\v 11 Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand?
\q Take your right hand from your garment and destroy them.

\s5
\q
\v 12 Yet God has been my king from ancient times,
\q bringing salvation on the earth.
\q
\v 13 You divided the sea by your strength;
\q you smashed the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.

\s5
\q
\v 14 You crushed the heads of leviathan;
\q you fed him to those living in the wilderness.
\q
\v 15 You broke open springs and streams;
\q you dried up flowing rivers.

\s5
\q
\v 16 The day is yours, and the night is yours also;
\q you set the sun and moon in place.
\q
\v 17 You have set all the borders of the earth;
\q you have made summer and winter.

\s5
\q
\v 18 Call to mind how the enemy hurled insults at you, Yahweh,
\q and that a foolish people has blasphemed your name.
\q
\v 19 Do not give the life of your dove to a wild animal.
\q Do not forget forever the life of your oppressed people.

\s5
\q
\v 20 Remember your covenant,

\v 16 He made streams flow out of the rock
\q and made the water flow like rivers.

\s5
\q
\v 17 Yet they continued to sin against him,
\q rebelling against the Most High in the wilderness.
\q
\v 18 They challenged God in their hearts
\q by asking for food to satisfy their appetites.

\s5
\q
\v 19 They spoke against God;
\q they said, "Can God really lay out a table for us in the wilderness?
\q
\v 20 See, when he struck the rock, waters gushed out
\q and streams overflowed.
\q But can he give bread also?
\q Will he provide meat for his people?"

\s5
\q
\v 21 When Yahweh heard this, he was angry;
\q so his fire burned against Jacob,
\q and his anger attacked Israel,
\q
\v 22 because they did not believe in God
\q and did not trust in his salvation.

\s5
\q
\v 23 Yet he commanded the skies above
\q and opened the doors of the sky.
\q
\v 24 He rained down manna for them to eat,
\q and gave them the grain from heaven.
\q
\v 25 People ate the bread of angels.
\q He sent them food in abundance.

\s5
\q
\v 26 He caused the east wind to blow in the sky,
\q and by his power he guided the south wind.
\q
\v 27 He rained down meat on them like dust,
\q birds as numerous as the sands of the sea.
\q
\v 28 They fell in the middle of their camp,
\q all around their tents.

\s5
\q
\v 29 So they ate and were full.
\q He gave them what they craved.
\q
\v 30 But they had not yet filled up;
\q their food was still in their mouths.

\s5
\q
\v 31 Then God's anger attacked them
\q and killed the strongest of them.
\q He brought down the young men of Israel.
\q
\v 32 Despite this, they continued to sin
\q and did not believe his wonderful deeds.

\s5
\q
\v 33 Therefore God cut short their days;
\q their years were filled with terror.
\q
\v 34 Whenever God afflicted them, they would start to seek him,
\q and they would return and look earnestly for him.

\s5
\q
\v 35 They would call to mind that God was their rock
\q and that the Most High God was their rescuer.
\q
\v 36 But they would flatter him with their mouth
\q and lie to him with their words.
\q
\v 37 For their hearts were not firmly fixed on him,
\q and they were not faithful to his covenant.

\s5
\q
\v 38 Yet he, being merciful, forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them.
\q Yes, many times he held back his anger
\q and did not stir up all his wrath.

\s5
\q
\v 39 He called to mind that they were made of flesh,
\q a wind that passes away and does not return.
\q
\v 40 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness
\q and grieved him in the barren regions!
\q
\v 41 Again and again they challenged God
\q and offended the Holy One of Israel.

\s5
\q
\v 42 They did not think about his power,
\q how he had rescued them from the enemy
\q
\v 43 when he performed his terrifying signs in Egypt
\q and his wonders in the region of Zoan.

\s5
\q
\v 44 He turned the Egyptians' rivers to blood
\q so that they could not drink from their streams.
\q
\v 45 He sent swarms of flies that devoured them
\q and frogs that overran their land.
\q
\v 46 He gave their crops to the grasshopper
\q and their labor to the locust.

\s5
\q
\v 47 He destroyed their vines with hail
\q and their sycamore trees with more hail.
\q
\v 48 He rained hail on their cattle
\q and hurled lightning bolts at their livestock.
\q
\v 49 The fierceness of his anger lashed out against them.
\q He sent wrath, fury, and trouble
\q like agents who bring disaster.

\s5
\q
\v 50 He leveled a path for his anger;
\q he did not spare them from death
\q but gave them over to the plague.
\q
\v 51 He killed all the firstborn in Egypt,
\q the firstborn of their strength in the tents of Ham.

\s5
\q
\v 52 He led his own people out like sheep
\q and guided them through the wilderness like a flock.
\q
\v 53 He led them secure and unafraid,
\q but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

\s5
\q
\v 54 Then he brought them to the border of his holy land,
\q to this mountain that his right hand acquired.
\q
\v 55 He drove out the nations from before them
\q and assigned them their inheritance.
\q He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.

\s5
\q
\v 56 Yet they challenged and defied the Most High God
\q and did not keep his solemn commands.
\q
\v 57 They were unfaithful and acted treacherously like their fathers;
\q they were as undependable as a faulty bow.

\s5
\q
\v 58 For they made him angry with their high places
\q and provoked him to jealous anger with their idols.
\q
\v 59 When God heard this, he was angry
\q and completely rejected Israel.

\s5
\q
\v 60 He abandoned the sanctuary of Shiloh,
\q the tent where he had lived among people.
\q
\v 61 He allowed his strength to be captured
\q and gave his glory into the enemy's hand.

\s5
\q
\v 62 He handed his people over to the sword,
\q and he was angry with his heritage.
\q
\v 63 Fire devoured their young men,
\q and their young women had no wedding songs.

\s5
\q
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword,
\q and their widows could not weep.
\q
\v 65 Then the Lord awakened as one from sleep,
\q like a warrior who shouts because of wine.
\q
\v 66 He drove his adversaries back;
\q he put them to everlasting shame.

\s5
\q
\v 67 He rejected the tent of Joseph,
\q and he did not chose the tribe of Ephraim.
\q
\v 68 He chose the tribe of Judah
\q and Mount Zion that he loved.
\q
\v 69 He built his sanctuary like the heavens,
\q like the earth that he has established forever.

\s5
\q
\v 70 He chose David, his servant,
\q and took him from the sheepfolds.
\q
\v 71 He took him from following the ewes with their young, and he brought him
\q to be shepherd of Jacob, his people, and of Israel, his heritage.
\q
\v 72 David shepherded them with the integrity of his heart,
\q and he guided them with the skill of his hands.

\v 13 You have a mighty arm

\v 14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.

\v 16 They rejoice in your name all day long,

\q
\v 17 You are their majestic strength,

\v 19 Long ago you spoke in a vision to your faithful ones; \f + \ft Many mss have the singular \fqa faithful one \fqa* instead of \fqa faithful ones \fqa* . \f* 
\q you said, "I have set a crown on a mighty one." \f + \ft The MT has \fqa I will place help upon a warrior \fqa* . Some translate the word for \fqa help \fqa* as \fqa crown \fqa* and that is how the ULT has translated the word here. \f* 
\q I have raised up one chosen from among the people.
\q
\v 20 I have chosen David my servant;
\q with my holy oil have I anointed him.
\q
\v 21 My hand will support him;
\q my arm will strengthen him.
\q
\v 22 No enemy will deceive him;
\q no son of wickedness will oppress him.
\q
\v 23 I will crush his enemies before him;
\q I will kill those who hate him.

\s5
\q
\v 24 My truth and my covenant faithfulness will be with him;
\q by my name he will be victorious.
\q
\v 25 I will place his hand over the sea
\q and his right hand over the rivers.
\q
\v 26 He will call out to me, 'You are my Father,
\q my God, and the rock of my salvation.'

\s5
\q
\v 27 I also will place him as my firstborn son,
\q the most exalted of the kings of the earth.
\q
\v 28 I will extend my covenant faithfulness to him forever;
\q and my covenant with him will be secure.
\q
\v 29 I will make his descendants endure forever
\q and his throne as enduring as the skies above.

\s5
\q
\v 30 If his children forsake my law

\q
\v 31 if they break my rules
\q and do not keep my commands,
\q
\v 32 then will I punish their rebellion with a rod
\q and their iniquity with blows.

\s5
\q
\v 33 But I will not remove my steadfast love from him
\q or be unfaithful to my promise.
\q
\v 34 I will not break my covenant
\q or change the words of my lips.

\s5
\q
\v 35 Once and for all I have
 sworn by my holiness—
\q I will not lie to David:

\v 36 his descendants will continue forever

\q
\v 37 It will be established forever like the moon,

\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 38 But you have refused and rejected;
\q you have been angry with your anointed king.
\q
\v 39 You have renounced the covenant of your servant.
\q You have desecrated his crown on the ground.
\q
\v 40 You have broken down all his walls.
\q You have ruined his strongholds.

\s5
\q
\v 41 All who pass by have robbed him.
\q He has become an object of disgust to his neighbors.
\q
\v 42 You have raised the right hand of his enemies;
\q you have made all his enemies rejoice.
\q
\v 43 You turn back the edge of his sword
\q and have not made him stand when in battle.

\s5
\q
\v 44 You have brought his splendor to an end;
\q you have brought down his throne to the ground.
\q
\v 45 You have shortened the days of his youth.
\q You have covered him with shame.
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 46 How long, Yahweh? Will you hide yourself, forever?
\q How long will your anger burn like fire?
\q
\v 47 Oh, think about how short my time is,
\q and for what uselessness you have created all the children of mankind!
\q

\q
\v 1 Lord, you have been our refuge
\q throughout all generations.
\q
\v 2 Before the mountains were formed,
\q or you formed the earth and the world,
\q from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.

\s5
\q
\v 3 You return man to dust,
\q and you say, "Return, you descendants of mankind."
\q
\v 4 For a thousand years in your sight
\q are as yesterday when it is past,
\q and as a watch in the night.

\s5
\q
\v 5 You sweep them away as with a flood and they sleep;
\q in the morning they are like the grass that sprouts up.
\q
\v 6 In the morning it blooms and grows up;
\q in the evening it withers and dries up.

\s5
\q
\v 7 Truly, we are consumed in your anger,
\q and in your wrath we are terrified.
\q
\v 8 You have set our iniquities before you,
\q our hidden sins in the light of your presence.

\s5
\q
\v 9 Our life passes away under your wrath;
\q our years quickly pass like a sigh.
\q
\v 10 Our years are seventy,
\q or even eighty if we are healthy;
\q but even our best years are marked by trouble and sorrow.
\q Yes, they pass quickly, and we fly away.

\s5
\q
\v 11 Who knows the intensity of your anger,
\q and your wrath that is equal to the fear of you?
\q
\v 12 So teach us to consider our life
\q so that we might live wisely.
\q
\v 13 Turn back, Yahweh! How long will it be?
\q Have pity on your servants.

\s5
\q
\v 14 Satisfy us in the morning with your covenant faithfulness
\q so that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
\q
\v 15 Make us glad in proportion to the days you afflicted us
\q and to the years we have experienced trouble.
\q
\v 16 Let your servants see your work,
\q and let our children see your majesty.

\s5
\q
\v 17 May the favor of the Lord our God be ours;
\q prosper the work of our hands;
\q indeed, prosper the work of our hands.


\s5
\c 91
\m
\q
\v 1 He who lives in the shelter of the Most High
\q will stay in the shadow of the Almighty.
\q
\v 2 I will say of Yahweh, "He is my refuge and my fortress,
\q my God, in whom I trust."

\s5
\q
\v 3 For he will rescue you from the snare of the hunter
\q and from the deadly plague.
\q
\v 4 He will cover you with his wings,
\q and under his wings you will find refuge.
\q His trustworthiness is a shield and protection.

\s5
\q
\v 5 You will not be afraid of terror in the night,
\q or of the arrow that flies by day,
\q
\v 6 or of the plague that roams around in the darkness,
\q or of the disease that comes at noontime.
\q
\v 7 A thousand may fall at your side
\q and ten thousand at your right hand,
\q but it will not reach you.

\s5
\q
\v 8 You will only observe
\q and see the punishment of the wicked.
\q
\v 9 For Yahweh is my refuge!
\q Make the Most High your refuge also.

\s5
\q
\v 10 No evil will overtake you;
\q no affliction will come near your home.
\q
\v 11 For he will direct his angels to protect you,
\q to guard you in all your ways.

\s5
\q
\v 12 They will lift you up with their hand
\q so that you will not hit your foot on a stone.
\q
\v 13 You will crush lions and adders under your feet;
\q you will trample on young lions and serpents.

\s5
\q
\v 14 Because he is devoted to me, I will rescue him.
\q I will protect him because he is loyal to me.
\q
\v 15 When he calls to me, I will answer him.
\q I will be with him in trouble;
\q I will give him victory and will honor him.
\q
\v 16 I will satisfy him with the length of his days,
\q and show him my salvation.

\m
\d A psalm, a song for the Sabbath day.
\q
\v 1 It is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh
\q and to sing praises to your name, Most High,
\q
\v 2 to proclaim your covenant faithfulness in the morning
\q and your truthfulness every night,
\q
\v 3 with a harp of ten strings
\q and with the melody of the lyre.

\s5
\q
\v 4 For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your deeds.
\q I will sing for joy because of the deeds of your hands.
\q
\v 5 How great are your deeds, Yahweh!
\q Your thoughts are very deep.

\s5
\q
\v 6 A brutish person does not know,
\q nor does a fool understand this:
\q
\v 7 When the wicked sprout like the grass,
\q and even when all the evildoers thrive,
\q still they are doomed to eternal destruction.

\s5
\q
\v 8 But you, Yahweh, will reign forever.
\q
\v 9 Indeed, look at your enemies, Yahweh!
\q Indeed, look at your enemies. They will perish!
\q All those who do evil will be scattered.

\s5
\q
\v 10 You have lifted up my horn like the horn of the wild ox;
\q I am anointed with fresh oil.
\q
\v 11 My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies;
\q my ears have heard of the doom of my evil foes.

\s5
\q
\v 12 The righteous will flourish like the palm tree;
\q they will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
\q
\v 13 They are planted in the house of Yahweh;
\q they flourish in the courts of our God.

\s5
\q
\v 14 They bear fruit even when they are old;
\q they stay fresh and green,
\q
\v 15 to proclaim that Yahweh is just.
\q He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.


\s5
\c 93
\q
\v 1 Yahweh reigns; he is robed in majesty;
\q Yahweh has clothed and girded himself with strength.
\q The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.

\q they have lifted up their voice;
\q the oceans' waves crash and roar.
\q
\v 4 Above the crashing of many waves,
\q the mighty breakers of the sea,
\q Yahweh on high is mighty.

\s5
\q
\v 3 How long will the wicked, Yahweh,
\q how long will the wicked rejoice?
\q
\v 4 They pour out their arrogant words;
\q all those who do evil boast.

\s5
\q
\v 5 They crush your people, Yahweh;
\q they afflict the nation that belongs to you.
\q
\v 6 They kill the widow and foreigner who lives in their country,
\q and they murder the fatherless.
\q
\v 7 They say, "Yahweh will not see,
\q the God of Jacob does not take notice of it."

\s5
\q
\v 8 Understand, you stupid people!
\q You fools, when will you ever learn?
\q
\v 9 He who made the ear, does he not hear?
\q He who formed the eye, does he not see?

\s5
\q
\v 10 He who disciplines the nations, does he not correct?
\q He is the one who gives knowledge to man.
\q
\v 11 Yahweh knows the thoughts of men,
\q that they are vapor.

\s5
\q
\v 12 Blessed is the one whom you instruct, Yahweh,
\q the one whom you teach from your law.
\q
\v 13 You give him rest in times of trouble
\q until a pit is dug for the wicked.

\s5
\q
\v 14 For Yahweh will not forsake his people
\q or abandon his inheritance.
\q
\v 15 For judgment will again be righteous;
\q and all the upright in heart will follow it.
\q
\v 16 Who will rise up to defend me against the evildoers?
\q Who will stand up for me against the wicked?

\s5
\q
\v 17 Unless Yahweh had been my help,
\q I would soon be lying down in the place of silence.
\q
\v 18 When I said, "My foot is slipping,"
\q Your covenant faithfulness, Yahweh, held me up.
\q
\v 19 When cares within me are many, your consolations make me happy.

\v 20 Can a throne of destruction be allied with you,
\q one who creates injustice by statute?
\q
\v 21 They conspire together to take the life of the righteous
\q and they condemn the innocent to death.

\s5
\q
\v 22 But Yahweh has been my high tower,
\q and my God has been the rock of my refuge.

\v 8 "Do not harden your heart, as at Meribah,

\v 3 He forgives all your sins;
\q he heals all your diseases.
\q
\v 4 He redeems your life from destruction;
\q he crowns you with covenant faithfulness and acts of tender mercy.
\q
\v 5 He satisfies your life with good things
\q so that your youth is renewed like the eagle.

\s5
\q
\v 6 Yahweh does what is fair
\q and does acts of justice for all who are oppressed.
\q
\v 7 He made known his ways to Moses,
\q his deeds to the descendants of Israel.
\q
\v 8 Yahweh is merciful and gracious;
\q he is patient; he has great covenant loyalty.

\s5
\q
\v 9 He will not always discipline;
\q he is not always angry.
\q
\v 10 He does not deal with us as our sins deserve
\q or repay us for what our sins demand.

\s5
\q
\v 11 For as the skies are high above the earth,
\q so great is his covenant faithfulness toward those who honor him.
\q
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west,
\q this is how far he has removed the guilt of our sins from us.
\q
\v 13 As a father has compassion on his children,
\q so Yahweh has compassion on those who honor him.

\s5
\q
\v 14 For he knows how we are formed;
\q he knows that we are dust.
\q
\v 15 As for man, his days are like grass;
\q he flourishes like a flower in a field.
\q
\v 16 The wind blows over it, and it disappears,
\q and no one can even tell where it once grew.

\s5
\q
\v 17 But the covenant faithfulness of Yahweh is from everlasting to everlasting on those who honor him.
\q His righteousness extends to their descendants.
\q
\v 18 They keep his covenant
\q and remember to obey his instructions.
\q
\v 19 Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens,
\q and his kingdom rules over everyone.

\s5
\q
\v 20 Give praise to Yahweh, you his angels,
\q you mighty ones who are strong and do his word,
\q and obey the sound of his word.
\q
\v 21 Give praise to Yahweh, all his hosts,
\q you are his servants who carry out his will.
\q
\v 22 Give praise to Yahweh, all his creatures,
\q in all the places where he reigns.
\q I will give praise to Yahweh with all my life.


\s5
\c 104
\m
\q
\v 1 I give praise to Yahweh with all my life,
\q Yahweh my God, you are very magnificent;
\q you are clothed with splendor and majesty.
\q
\v 2 You cover yourself with light as with a garment;
\q you spread out the heavens like a tent curtain.
\q
\v 3 You lay the beams of your chambers on the clouds;
\q you make the clouds your chariot;
\q you walk on the wings of the wind.

\s5
\q
\v 4 He makes the winds his messengers,
\q flames of fire his servants.
\q
\v 5 He laid the foundations of the earth,
\q and it will never be moved.

\s5
\q
\v 6 You covered the earth with water like a garment;
\q the water covered the mountains.
\q
\v 7 Your rebuke made the waters recede;
\q at the sound of your thunderous voice they fled.

\s5
\q
\v 8 The mountains rose, and the valleys spread out
\q into the places that you had appointed for them.
\q
\v 9 You have set a boundary for them that they will not cross;
\q they will not cover the earth again.

\s5
\q
\v 10 He made springs flow into the valleys;
\q the streams flow between the mountains.
\q
\v 11 They supply water for all the animals of the field;
\q the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
\q
\v 12 By the riverbanks the birds build their nests;
\q they sing among the branches.

\s5
\q
\v 13 He waters the mountains from his water chambers in the sky.
\q The earth is filled with the fruit of his labor.
\q
\v 14 He makes the grass grow for the cattle
\q and plants for man to cultivate
\q so that man may produce food from the earth.
\q
\v 15 He makes wine to make man happy,
\q oil to make his face shine,
\q and food to sustain his life.

\s5
\q
\v 16 The trees of Yahweh get plenty of rain;
\q the cedars of Lebanon which he planted.
\q
\v 17 There the birds make their nests.
\q The stork makes the cypress tree her home.
\q
\v 18 The wild goats live on the high mountains;
\q the mountain heights are a refuge for the hyraxes.

\s5
\q
\v 19 He appointed the moon to mark the seasons;
\q the sun knows its time for setting.
\q
\v 20 You make the darkness of the night
\q when all the beasts of the forest come out.

\s5
\q
\v 21 The young lions roar for their prey
\q and seek their food from God.
\q
\v 22 When the sun rises, they retreat
\q and sleep in their dens.

\s5
\q
\v 23 Meanwhile, people go out to their work
\q and labor away until the evening.
\q
\v 24 Yahweh, how many and varied are your works!
\q With wisdom you made them all;
\q the earth overflows with your works.

\s5
\q
\v 25 Over there is the sea, deep and wide,
\q teeming with innumerable creatures,
\q both small and great.
\q
\v 26 The ships travel there,
\q and Leviathan is also there, which you formed to play in the sea.

\s5
\q
\v 27 All these look to you to give them
\q their food on time.
\q
\v 28 When you give to them, they gather;
\q when you open your hand, they are satisfied.

\s5
\q
\v 29 When you hide your face, they are troubled;
\q if you take away their breath, they die
\q and return to dust.
\q
\v 30 When you send out your Spirit, they are created,
\q and you renew the countryside.

\s5
\q
\v 31 May the glory of Yahweh last forever;
\q may Yahweh enjoy his creation.
\q
\v 32 He looks down on the earth, and it shakes;
\q he touches the mountains, and they smoke.

\s5
\q
\v 33 I will sing to Yahweh all my life;
\q I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
\q
\v 34 May my thoughts be sweet to him;
\q I will rejoice in Yahweh.

\s5
\q
\v 35 May sinners vanish from the earth,
\q and let the wicked be no more.
\q I give praise to Yahweh with all my life.
\q Praise Yahweh.

\s5

\v 4 Seek Yahweh and his strength;

\q
\v 5 Recall the marvelous things he has done,
\q his miracles and the decrees from his mouth,
\q
\v 6 you descendants of Abraham his servant,
\q you people of Jacob, his chosen ones.

\s5
\q
\v 7 He is Yahweh, our God.
\q His decrees are on all the earth.
\q
\v 8 He keeps in mind his covenant forever,
\q the word that he commanded for a thousand generations.

\s5
\q
\v 9 He calls to mind the covenant that he made with Abraham
\q and his oath to Isaac.
\q
\v 10 This is what he confirmed to Jacob as a statute
\q and to Israel as an everlasting covenant.
\q
\v 11 He said, "I will give you the land of Canaan
\q as your share of your inheritance."

\s5
\q
\v 12 He said this when they were only few in number,
\q so very few, and were strangers in the land.
\q
\v 13 They went from nation to nation
\q and from one kingdom to another.

\s5
\q
\v 14 He did not allow anyone to oppress them;
\q he rebuked kings for their sakes.
\q
\v 15 He said, "Do not touch my anointed ones,
\q and do not harm my prophets."

\s5
\q
\v 16 He called for a famine on the land;
\q he cut off the whole supply of bread.
\q
\v 17 He sent a man ahead of them;
\q Joseph was sold as a servant.

\s5
\q
\v 18 His feet were bound by shackles;
\q on his neck was put an iron collar,
\q
\v 19 until what he had said came to pass.
\q The word of Yahweh tested him.

\s5
\q
\v 20 The king sent servants to release him;
\q the ruler of the people set him free.
\q
\v 21 He put him in charge of his house
\q as ruler of all his possessions
\q
\v 22 to instruct his princes as he wished
\q and to teach his elders wisdom.
\q
\v 23 Then Israel came into Egypt,
\q and Jacob lived for a time in the land of Ham.

\s5
\q
\v 24 Yahweh made his people fruitful,
\q and made them stronger than their enemies.
\q
\v 25 He caused their enemies to hate his people,
\q to mistreat his servants.
\q
\v 26 He sent Moses, his servant,
\q and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
\q
\v 27 They performed his signs among the Egyptians,
\q his wonders in the land of Ham.

\s5
\q
\v 28 He sent darkness and made that land dark,
\q but its people did not obey his commands.
\q
\v 29 He turned their water into blood
\q and killed their fish.
\q
\v 30 Their land swarmed with frogs,
\q even in the rooms of their rulers.

\s5
\q
\v 31 He spoke, and swarms of flies and gnats came
\q throughout their country.
\q
\v 32 He turned their rain into hail,
\q with fire flaming on their land.
\q
\v 33 He destroyed their vines and fig trees;
\q he broke the trees of their country.

\s5
\q
\v 34 He spoke, and the locusts came,
\q so many locusts.
\q
\v 35 The locusts ate up all of the vegetation in their land;
\q They ate up all the crops of the ground.
\q
\v 36 He killed every firstborn in their land,
\q the firstfruits of all their strength.

\s5
\q
\v 37 He brought the Israelites out with silver and gold;
\q none of his tribes stumbled on the way.
\q
\v 38 Egypt was glad when they went away,
\q for the Egyptians were afraid of them.
\q
\v 39 He spread a cloud for a covering
\q and made a fire to light up the night.

\s5
\q
\v 40 The Israelites asked for food, and he brought quail
\q and satisfied them with bread from heaven.
\q
\v 41 He split the rock, and waters gushed from it;
\q they flowed in the wilderness like a river.
\q
\v 42 For he called to mind his holy promise
\q that he made to Abraham his servant.

\s5
\q
\v 43 He led his people out with joy,
\q his chosen with shouts of triumph.
\q
\v 44 He gave them the lands of the nations;
\q they took possession of the wealth of the peoples
\q
\v 45 so that they might keep his statutes
\q and obey his laws.
\q Praise Yahweh.

\q Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,

\v 2 Who can recount the mighty acts of Yahweh
\q or proclaim in full all his praiseworthy deeds?

\s5
\q
\v 3 Blessed are those who do what is right,
\q and whose deeds are always just.
\q
\v 4 Call me to mind, Yahweh, when you show favor to your people;
\q help me when you save them.
\q
\v 5 Then I will see the prosperity of your chosen,
\q rejoice in the gladness of your nation,
\q and glory with your inheritance.

\s5
\q
\v 6 We have sinned like our ancestors;
\q we have done wrong, and we have done evil.
\q
\v 7 Our fathers did not appreciate your marvelous deeds in Egypt;
\q they ignored your many acts of covenant faithfulness;
\q they were rebellious at the sea, the Sea of Reeds.

\s5
\q
\v 8 Nevertheless, he saved them for his name's sake
\q so that he might reveal his power.
\q
\v 9 He rebuked the Sea of Reeds, and it dried up.
\q Then he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.

\s5
\q
\v 10 He saved them from the hand of those who hated them,
\q and he rescued them from the hand of the enemy.
\q
\v 11 But the waters covered their adversaries;
\q not one of them survived.
\q
\v 12 Then they believed his words,
\q and they sang his praise.

\s5
\q
\v 13 But they quickly forgot what he had done;
\q they did not wait for his instructions.
\q
\v 14 They had insatiable cravings in the wilderness,
\q and they challenged God in the desert.
\q
\v 15 So he gave them what they requested, 
\q2 but he sent a horrible disease upon them.

\s5
\q
\v 16 In the camp they became jealous of Moses
\q and Aaron, the holy priest of Yahweh.
\q
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan
\q and covered the followers of Abiram.
\q
\v 18 Fire broke out among them;
\q the fire consumed the wicked.

\s5
\q
\v 19 They made a calf at Horeb
\q and worshiped a cast metal figure.
\q
\v 20 They traded the glory of God
\q for the image of a bull that eats grass.
\q
\v 21 They forgot God their Savior,
\q who had done great deeds in Egypt.

\s5
\q
\v 22 He had done wonderful things in the land of Ham
\q and mighty acts at the Sea of Reeds.
\q
\v 23 So he said he would destroy them—
\q had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him,
\q to turn away his anger from destroying them.

\s5
\q
\v 24 Then they despised the fruitful land;
\q they did not believe his promise,
\q
\v 25 but grumbled in their tents,
\q and did not obey Yahweh.

\s5
\q
\v 26 Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them
\q that he would let them die in the desert,
\q
\v 27 scatter their descendants among the nations,
\q and scatter them in foreign lands.

\s5
\q
\v 28 They worshiped the Baal of Peor
\q and ate the sacrifices offered to the dead.
\q
\v 29 They provoked him to anger with their actions,
\q and a plague broke out among them.

\s5
\q
\v 30 Then Phinehas rose to intervene,
\q and the plague subsided.
\q
\v 31 It was counted to him as a righteous deed
\q to all generations forever.

\s5
\q
\v 32 They also angered Yahweh at the waters of Meribah,
\q and Moses suffered because of them.
\q
\v 33 They made Moses bitter,
\q and he spoke rashly.
\q
\v 34 They did not destroy the nations
\q as Yahweh had commanded them,
\q
\v 35 but they mingled with the nations
\q and learned their ways
\q
\v 36 and worshiped their idols,
\q which became a snare to them.

\s5
\q
\v 37 They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
\q
\v 38 They shed innocent blood,
\q the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
\q whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan,
\q desecrating the land with blood.
\q
\v 39 They were defiled by their deeds;
\q in their actions they were like prostitutes.

\s5
\q
\v 40 So Yahweh was angry with his people,
\q and he despised his own people.
\q
\v 41 He gave them into the hand of the nations,
\q and those who hated them ruled over them.

\s5
\q
\v 42 Their enemies oppressed them,
\q and they were brought into subjection to their authority.
\q
\v 43 Many times he came to help them,
\q but they kept rebelling
\q and were brought low by their own sin.

\s5
\q
\v 44 Nevertheless, he paid attention to their distress
\q when he heard their cry for help.
\q
\v 45 He called to mind his covenant with them
\q and relented because of his steadfast love.
\q
\v 46 He caused all their conquerers
\q to have pity on them.
\s5
\q
\v 47 Save us, Yahweh, our God.
\q Gather us from among the nations
\q so that we may give thanks to your holy name
\q and glory in your praises.
\q
\v 48 May Yahweh, the God of Israel, be praised
\q from everlasting to everlasting.
\q All the people said, "Amen."
\q Praise Yahweh.

\q
\v 1 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,

\q
\v 2 Let the redeemed of Yahweh speak out,
\q those he has rescued from the hand of the enemy.
\q
\v 3 He has gathered them out of foreign lands,
\q from the east and from the west,
\q from the north and from the south.

\s5
\q
\v 4 They wandered in the wilderness on a desert road
\q and found no city in which to live.
\q
\v 5 Because they were hungry and thirsty,
\q they fainted from exhaustion.
\q
\v 6 Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble,
\q and he rescued them out of their distress.
\q
\v 7 He led them by a direct path
\q so that they would go to a city to live in.

\s5
\q
\v 8 Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness
\q and for the amazing things he has done for humanity!
\q
\v 9 For he satisfies the longings of those who are thirsty,
\q and the desires of those who are hungry he fills up with good things.
\q
\v 10 Some sat in darkness and in gloom,
\q prisoners in affliction and chains.

\s5
\q
\v 11 This was because they had rebelled against God's word
\q and rejected the instruction of the Most High.
\q
\v 12 He humbled their hearts through hardship;
\q they stumbled and there was no one to help them up.
\q
\v 13 Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble,
\q and he brought them out of their distress.

\s5
\q
\v 14 He brought them out of darkness and gloom
\q and broke their bonds.
\q
\v 15 Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness
\q and for the amazing things he has done for humanity!
\q
\v 16 For he has broken the gates of bronze
\q and cut through the bars of iron.

\s5
\q
\v 17 They were foolish in their rebellious ways
\q and afflicted because of their sins.
\q
\v 18 They lost their desire to eat any food,
\q and they came close to the gates of death.
\q
\v 19 Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble,
\q and he brought them out of their distress.

\s5
\q
\v 20 He sent his word and healed them,
\q and he rescued them from their destruction.
\q
\v 21 Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness
\q and for the amazing things he has done for humanity!
\q
\v 22 Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving
\q and proclaim his deeds in singing.

\s5
\q
\v 23 Some travel on the sea in ships
\q and do business overseas.
\q
\v 24 These saw the deeds of Yahweh
\q and his wonders on the seas.

\s5
\q
\v 25 For he commanded and aroused the windstorm
\q that stirs up the seas.
\q
\v 26 They reached up to the sky; they went down to the depths.
\q Their lives melted away in distress.
\q
\v 27 They swayed and staggered like drunkards
\q and were at their wits' end.

\s5
\q
\v 28 Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble,
\q and he brought them out of their distress.
\q
\v 29 He calmed the storm,
\q and the waves were stilled.
\q
\v 30 Then they rejoiced because the sea was calm,
\q and he brought them to their desired harbor.

\s5
\q
\v 31 Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness
\q and for the amazing things he has done for humanity!
\q
\v 32 Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people
\q and praise him in the council of the elders.

\s5
\q
\v 33 He turns rivers into a wilderness,
\q springs of water into dry land,
\q
\v 34 and a fruitful land into a barren place
\q because of the wickedness of its people.
\q
\v 35 He turns the wilderness into a pool of water
\q and dry land into springs of water.

\s5
\q
\v 36 He settles the hungry there,
\q and they build a city to live in.
\q
\v 37 They build a city to plant fields in, to plant vineyards,
\q and to bring in an abundant harvest.
\q
\v 38 He blesses them so they are very numerous.
\q He does not let their cattle decrease in number.

\s5
\q
\v 39 They were diminished and brought low
\q by painful distress and suffering.
\q
\v 40 He pours contempt on the leaders
\q and causes them to wander in the wilderness, where there are no roads.

\s5
\q
\v 41 But he protects the needy from affliction
\q and cares for his families like a flock.
\q
\v 42 The upright will see this and rejoice,
\q and all wickedness shuts its mouth.

\v 43 Whoever is wise should take note of these things
\q and meditate on Yahweh's acts of covenant faithfulness.

\q
\v 8 May his days be few;

\q
\v 9 May his children be fatherless,
\q and may his wife be a widow.

\v 16 May Yahweh do this because this man never bothered to show any covenant faithfulness,
\q but instead harassed the oppressed, the needy,
\q and the disheartened to death.

\q
\v 17 He loved cursing; may it come back upon him.
\q He hated blessing; may no blessing come to him.

\q
\v 2 Yahweh will hold out the scepter of your strength from Zion;

\s5
\q
\v 4 Yahweh has sworn, and will not change:
\q "You are a priest forever,
\q after the manner of Melchizedek."

\s5
\q
\v 5 The Lord is at your right hand.
\q He will kill kings on the day of his anger.
\q
\v 6 He will judge the nations;

\q You have made your word and your name more important than anything else.

\s5
\q

\q you made me bold and strengthened my soul.

\q
\v 4 All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, Yahweh,
\q for they will hear the words from your mouth.

\s5
\q
\v 5 Indeed, they will sing of the deeds of Yahweh,
\q for great is the glory of Yahweh.
\q
\v 6 For though Yahweh is high, yet he cares for the lowly,
\q but the proud he knows from far off.

\s5
\q
\v 7 Though I walk in the middle of danger, you will preserve my life;
\q you will reach out with your hand against the anger of my enemies,
\q and your right hand will save me.

\q Do not forsake the ones whom your hands have made.

\m
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, you have examined me, and you know me.
\q
\v 2 You know when I sit down and when I get up;
\q you understand my thoughts from far away.

\s5
\q
\v 3 You observe my path and my lying down;
\q you are familiar with all my ways.
\q
\v 4 For before there is a word on my tongue,
\q you know it completely, Yahweh.
\q
\v 5 Behind me and before me you surround me
\q and place your hand upon me.
\q
\v 6 Such knowledge is too much for me;
\q it is too high, and I cannot reach it.

\s5
\q
\v 7 Where can I go from your Spirit?
\q Where can I flee from your presence?
\q
\v 8 If I ascend up to the heavens, you are there;
\q if I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there.

\s5
\q
\v 9 If I fly away on the wings of the morning
\q and go to live in the uttermost parts across the sea,
\q
\v 10 even there your hand will lead me,
\q your right hand will hold on to me.

\s5
\q
\v 11 If I said, "Surely the darkness will cover me,
\q and the light will become night around me,"
\q
\v 12 even the darkness would not be dark to you.
\q The night would shine like the day,
\q for the darkness and the light are both alike to you.

\s5
\q
\v 13 You formed my inner parts;
\q you formed me in my mother's womb.
\q
\v 14 I will praise you,
\q for I am wonderfully made.
\q My soul knows this very well.

\s5
\q
\v 15 My bones were not hidden from you
\q when I was made in private,
\q when I was intricately made in the depths of the earth.
\q
\v 16 You saw me inside the womb;
\q all the days assigned to me were recorded
\q in your book even before the first one happened.

\s5
\q
\v 17 How precious are your thoughts to me, God!
\q How vast is their sum!
\q
\v 18 If I tried to count them, they would be more in number than the sand.
\q When I awake, I am still with you.

\s5
\q
\v 19 If only you would kill the wicked, God;
\q get away from me, you violent men.
\q
\v 20 They rebel against you and act deceitfully;
\q your enemies tell lies.

\s5
\q
\v 21 Do I not hate those, Yahweh, who hate you?
\q Do I not despise those who rise up against you?
\q
\v 22 I hate them completely;
\q they have become my enemies.

\s5
\q
\v 23 Examine me, God, and know my heart;

\v 24 See if there is any wicked way in me,
\q and lead me in the everlasting way.

\s5
\q
\v 6 I said to Yahweh, "You are my God;

\q
\v 7 Yahweh, my Lord, you are powerfully able to save me;

\s5
\q
